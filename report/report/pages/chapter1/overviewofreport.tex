\section{Overview Of This Report}

	\normalsize
	{
		As a keen software developer the product produced and encompassing report is entirely software centric.
		The following chapters presents a high level overview of the development artefacts and an evaluation 
		of these software artefacts.  Due to the size and nature of the project many areas of software engineering are touched on
		including networking, software architecture \& programming, facets of operating systems and enterprise management.
		As a result of this, I have tried to keep the report as succinct as possible. 
		\newline
		\newline
		Some discussion provides low-level detailed insights into facets of the implementation that may be of interest to the reader. 
		An overview of the technologies concerned is beyond the scope of this report, and discretion is advised.
