		An example of a high level use case is detailed in table \ref{tab:UseCasesample}.  Use cases
		were used to contrive test cases in line with the requirements in section \ref{sec:Scope}.
		By designing tests cases around actors and their actions; scenarios (instances of use cases)
		provided the best coverage for exploratory testing or black box testing and resulting quality assurement process.
		\newline
		\newline
		Use cases were further broken down into discrete use cases indicated by the description steps and extensions points
		in the use case sample \ref{tab:UseCasesample}.

		As this project was software-centric, testing played a huge role in the completion, successful delivery and resulting quality.
		One of the software fallacies (Perfect Software: And Other Illusions about Testing) 
		is the concept of testing for everything, otherwise known as exhaustive testing \citet{WeinbergSoftwareTesting}.   
		Therefore the application of use case realisation; the identification of collaborating objects in the application
		domain; offered the perfect means to derive test cases.

		The JetBrains Resharper utility was used as a white-box testing enhancement tool, which actively interrogated 
		the software under development.  Resharper looks for common problems such as possible null value exceptions, 
		code coverage and unreachable code, boundary value assessment etc.  Other utilities such as CodeRush by Devexpress have similar
		functionality.
