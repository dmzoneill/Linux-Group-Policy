\section{Qualitative Analysis}

	\normalsize
	{
		There are many software quality models that have been formulated for the determination of quality improvement and analysis.  
		It's important to understand that when doing a qualitative analysis that 'all models are flawed, but some are useful'.
		In my undergraduate learning a software quality model was undertaken were I learned about Software Process Improvement(SPI)
		as well as some of the models available for this process.  
		\newline
		\newline
		A Taxonomy to Compare software process improvement(SPI) Frameworks by Christian Printzell Halvorsen and Reidar Conradi can be used in the 
		determination of the suitable software process improvement(SPI) framework for an organisation, however this from 
		an under graduate perspective, qualitative aspects required in the field are realistically unachievable 
		such as Geographic origin/spread, scientific origin, development/stability or Popularity.  
		\newline
		\newline
		Similarly this issue arose in choosing a qualitative analysis model and as such the choice for the ISO/IEC 9126
		for the evaluation of software quality was accepted due to the high level nature of the model.
		\newline
		\newline
		ISO/IEC 9126 outlines the following characteristics and from a quick glace the reader should be able to identify that this quality
		model has a lot of the ``ilities'' or non functional requirements.

		The implementation met all the requirements set out in the objectives and as such is suitability functional.
		As security was not taken into account when under development, some changes have to be made in order to 
		comply with the ISO/IEC 9126 model.  Integration with site authentication mechanisms such as kerberos or some other
		public key technology would be the next logical step to ensure security compliance.

		to accomplish greater learnability and understandability from a non Linux administrator.

		The client server implementation has the ability to serve 1000 requests and replies in an 8 second period.
		This is more than sufficient to handle an large network environment.  A trade off had to be made for the implementation
		in terms of portability and extensibility, in that Perl was chosen instead of per say C++.  
		As PERL is an interpreted language is does not have the same efficiency as a compiled language such as C++. 
		In a large scale network, administrators would not rely on any one server to service all these requests and in 
		this case a round robin in the domain name service is setup to help load balance requests on servers.
		In this case the scalability of the implementation supersedes and negative efficiency factors.

		As per a modular design you would expect to see no coupling of the components, this is illustrated by the dependency graph in
		Fig.\ref{fig:DependancyMethodsRelationshipDiagram} \& \ref{fig:DependancyTypesRelationshipDiagram}.  
		This offers developers to ship updates to individual components.

		Fig.\ref{fig:DependancyMethodsRelationshipDiagram} shows the method relationship or method call coupling between each

		From these diagrams it is clearly indicated that there is no coupling of the implementation's 
		composite components and as previously stated this allows me to develop a composite component further and 
		ship this update separately if necessary.

	{
		The client server product is based upon Perl for maximum portability.  Since all major distributions ship with Perl as default 
		this ensure maximum portability.  Further more the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) is accessible by Perl as default 
		and allows administrators to update and install Perl modules relatively easily.  
		\newline
		\newline
		Vendor specific PERL implementations such as ActiveState also provide this functionality of updating modules 
		on the fly.  As there is no compilation needed the installability of the 
		client is purely dependant on the existence of Perl on the particular distribution.
		\newline
		\newline
		Due to the modular nature of the client and the associated interpretor, the replaceability and adaptability of the client server
		implementation is a factor of the administrators ability to create modular tailored for the organisation's environment.
		\newline
		\newline
		In the long run, modules would be kept in a Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) fashion on a external server.
		Administrators mere only search this online repository for modules that can be integrated into there environment giving maximum 
		replaceability and adaptability.

		Time is a major concern in final year projects and as such the decision to undertake the project was carefully

		The cost factor for final year projects I believe has two aspects.  Unlike the monetary aspects of commercial software,
		final year projects have to be balanced in-line with other work in other subjects.  For the first semester of 4th year
		I achieved a semester grade of 3.6.  So the cost was relatively low in this regard.  The second cost for me was hair
		loss, i gave it about 25\%, I think I lost around 10\%, so it has been a ``win win'' in terms of cost so far!

	\subsection{Change Control}
	
		\normalsize
		{
			As the project manager is was my job to actively manage change control.  My supervisor
			tried a few times to change some of the requirements for which I was in favour and in some cases against.
			I knew the time, cost and scope of what had to be done and in most cases I rejected the changes put forth.
			\newline
			\newline
			Some projects have difficulties due to project managers accepting any and all change requests
			resulting in disillusioned, lack of direction development.  I was aware of this from previous experience
			and from the learning outcomes of the Project Management module I had done previously.
			\newline
			\newline
			The choice for me when accepting a change, is generally quiet simple and although may seem like the 'lazy'
			approach, it generally results in a favourable outcome.  Only minor changes would be accepted and they would result 
			in less scope.  The reason for this is based upon, how much development needs to change, and always to take less work,
			not more work.  Therefore if a change control results in less work in the future with an initial increase in work
			this is deemed acceptable.  This approach generally increases the overall quality of the software.
