	{
		The objective of this Final Year Project was to develop a Configuration Management framework that supported specification of policies for a Linux 
		heterogeneous environment. The framework had to be extensible, provide a rich user interface, and allow administrators to specify rules using a policy 
		oriented language in the form of a Domain Specific Language. Extensibility was largely achieved through the development of a composite-based architecture, 
		extensive specification of interfaces, and the use of reflection. The end result is an administrative platform that fulfils the functional 
		and non-functional requirements of the project, and an implementation that has been evaluated using stress testing and software quality metrics. 
		The ensuing critique is favourable but balanced, and the software artefact itself was well received by a knowledgeable audience.
